<header>How To Stop Stomach Ache Due To Gas</header>
<div id="container">
<h1>Gas trapped in the intestines can be incredibly uncomfortable. It may cause sharp pain, cramping, swelling, tightness, and even bloating.</h1>
<p><b>Eat slowly:</b> Eating too quickly or while moving can cause a person to take in air as well as food, leading to gas-related pain.
Quick eaters can slow down by chewing each bite of food 30 times. Breaking down food in such a way aids digestion and can prevent a number of related complaints, including bloating and indigestion.</p>
<p><b>Avoid chewing gum:</b> As a person chews gum they tend to swallow air, which increases the likelihood of trapped wind and gas pains.
Sugarless gum also contains artificial sweeteners, which may cause bloating and gas.</p>
<p><b>Say no to straws:</b> Often, drinking through a straw causes a person to swallow air. Drinking directly from a bottle can have the same effect, depending on the bottleâ€™s size and shape. To avoid gas pain and bloating, it is best to sip from a glass.</p>
<p><b>Quit smoking:</b> Whether using traditional or electronic cigarettes, smoking causes air to enter the digestive tract. Because of the range of health issues linked to smoking, quitting is wise for many reasons.</p>
<p><b>Choose non-carbonated drinks:</b> Carbonated drinks, such as sparkling water and sodas, send a lot of gas to the stomach. This can cause bloating and pain.</p>
<p><b>Clove oil:</b> Clove oil has traditionally been used to treat digestive complaints, including bloating, gas, and indigestion. It may also have ulcer-fighting properties.
Consuming clove oil after meals can increase digestive enzymes and reduce the amount of gas in the intestines.</p>
<p><b>Apply heat:</b> When gas pains strike, place a hot water bottle or heating pad on the stomach. The warmth relaxes the muscles in the gut, helping gas to move through the intestines. Heat can also reduce the sensation of pain.</p>
<p><b>Add apple cider vinegar to water:</b> Apple cider vinegar aids the production of stomach acid and digestive enzymes. It may also help to alleviate gas pain quickly. Add a tablespoon of the vinegar to a glass of water and drink it before meals to prevent gas pain and bloating. It is important to then rinse the mouth with water, as vinegar can erode tooth enamel.</p>
<p><b>Exercise:</b> Gentle exercises can relax the muscles in the gut, helping to move gas through the digestive system. Walking or doing yoga poses after meals may be especially beneficial.</p>
<p><b>Breathe deeply:</b> Deep breathing may not work for everyone. Taking in too much air can increase the amount of gas in the intestines.
However, some people find that deep breathing techniques can relieve the pain and discomfort associated with trapped gas.</p>
<p><b>Eliminate problematic foods:</b> Eating certain foods can cause trapped gas. Individuals find different foods problematic.</p>
<p>However, the foods below frequently cause gas to build up:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Artificial Sweeteners, such as Aspartame, Sorbitol, and Maltitol</li>
	<li>Cruciferous Vegetables, including Broccoli, Cabbage, and Cauliflower</li>
	<li>Dairy Products</li>
	<li>Fiber Drinks and Supplements</li>
	<li>Fried Foods</li>
	<li>Garlic and Onions</li>
	<li>High-Fat Foods</li>
	<li>Legumes, a group that includes Beans and Lentils</li>
	<li>Prunes and Prune Juice</li>
	<li>Spicy Foods</li></ul>
<p>Keeping a food diary can help a person to identify trigger foods. Some, like artificial sweeteners, may be easy to cut out of the diet.
Others, like cruciferous vegetables and legumes, provide a range of health benefits. Rather than avoiding them entirely, a person may try reducing their intake or preparing the foods differently.</p>
<p><b>Drink tea:</b> Some herbal teas may aid digestion and reduce gas pain fast. The most effective include teas made from:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Anise</li>
	<li>Chamomile</li>
	<li>Ginger</li>
	<li>Peppermint</li></ul>
	<p>Anise acts as a mild laxative and should be avoided if diarrhea accompanies gas. However, it can be helpful if constipation is responsible for trapped gas</p>
